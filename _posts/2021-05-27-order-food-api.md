### Try the API out: https://order-food-api.herokuapp.com/docs

*Note: Allow around 30 seconds for the API to respond to your first request. Heroku puts projects in the "free" tier to sleep if they haven't been visited in a specific amount of time.

## About the project
This is my first FastAPI project to be hosted on Heroku. Now, I've played with Heroku a few times and I've always enjoyed how easy it was run a project on Heroku and the huge number of add-ons.

Now, I haven't used a Postgres database in a while (I have an obsession with NoSQL databases and have been using them for a while) so I figured this would be a good project to use it again. Currently, this isn't an overly-complicated API but I do plan on adding to it over time.
